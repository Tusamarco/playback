Percona Playback is a tool for replaying the load of one database server to another.

see ./bin/percona-playback --help for details

Build Dependencies
------------------
Percona Playback is mostly comprised of plugins, some of which have their
own build dependencies (and simply won't be built if you don't have the
required libraries).

You will need the 'development' packages for all of these (often suffixed by
'-devel' for RedHat or '-dev' for Debian derived distributions).

The core of Percona Playback requires:
 * libtbb (Intel Threading Building Blocks)
 * Boost (including boost program_options) at least 1.41
 * libtool
 * gettext
 * intltool
 * pkg-config

The plugin that uses the MySQL client library needs:
 * libmysqlclient (MySQL Client Libraries)

For using the libdrizzle client library to speak to MySQL or Drizzle:
 * libdrizzle

For playing back tcpdump captured load:
 * libpcap
 * libdrizzle

Building
--------
If you are building from BZR, you will need to run ./config/autorun.sh first.

$ ./configure
$ make

Test Suite
----------
There are several tests included, these use a dummy database client plugin to mainly test that parsing of the logs is correct.

$ make check

Building release tarball
------------------------

$ make dist

Capturing everything in the slow log
------------------------------------
To capture queries for Percona Playback to play back, you will need to run MySQL, MariaDB or Percona Server with the slow query log capturing the queries you wish to run. You will need the following options to mysqld:

--slow-query-log --log-slow-admin-statements --log-slow-verbosity=microtime --long-query-time=0
